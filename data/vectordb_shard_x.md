# NeuralNexus Infrastructure: VectorDB-Shard-X

## 1. System Overview
**VectorDB-Shard-X** is a proprietary, distributed vector database engineered to handle the massive scale of embeddings generated by **Embedding-Gecko-002** (`embedding_gecko_002.md`). Unlike off-the-shelf solutions like Pinecone or Milvus, Shard-X is optimized for our specific hardware memory alignment.

## 2. Architecture
* **Algorithm:** Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs with Product Quantization (PQ).
* **Language:** Rust (Core), Python (Interface).
* **Sharding Key:** Customer tenant ID hash.
* **Consistency:** Eventual consistency (read-after-write latency ~200ms).

## 3. Performance Specifications
* **Total Vectors Stored:** 14 Billion.
* **Index Build Time:** 50ms per 10,000 vectors.
* **Query Latency (p99):** 25ms.
* **Recall:** 98% at top-10 retrieval.

## 4. Hardware Requirements
The database runs on a dedicated memory-optimized fleet.
* **RAM Usage:** 1.2 Terabytes (TB) total resident set size.
* **Disk usage:** 8 TB SSD.
* **Nodes:** 52 high-memory instances.

## 5. Cost Implications
As detailed in `cost_analysis_q3_2024.md`, the RAM requirements for Shard-X drive significant infrastructure costs.
* **Storage Cost:** High (due to RAM pricing).
* **Operation Cost:** $0.50 per GB/month.

## 6. Integration with Project Orion
For `project_orion_roadmap.md`, Shard-X utilizes a new "Metadata Filtering" feature (v2.4) that allows the Nexus-Goliath-v4 model to query vectors based on temporal ranges (e.g., "documents from last week").

## 7. Maintenance
* **Garbage Collection:** Runs daily at 03:00 UTC.
* **Rebalancing:** Automatic shard rebalancing occurs when a node exceeds 85% memory utilization.
